# Evaluate Code Maintainability

We will use a service called Code Climate to evaluate the maintainability of the code.

## What is Code Climete?

Of course, this one will pass through the build without fixing it too, but the length of it means that the method may have multiple roles and so on. The more concise it is, the easier it is to understand later on, so do so.

## How to use

First, create an account for code climate, and sign up with your Github account, since it will be linked to Github.
Note that there are two logins, velocity and quality, and we will use the quality one.
After you create an account, you will be prompted to select the repositories you want to integrate.

If you select the file of interest, you can see where the quality is degraded, and you can use it as a reference when making corrections.

## Pull request to work on

Set it up accordingly from the following sections of Code Climate
