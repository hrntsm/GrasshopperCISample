# Add Badge to README

This chapter describes how to badge the CI results in the README.

## Getting a badge of build results

You can get the results as a badge. Using it makes you feel like a well-maintained repository.
To create badges, you can use the service [shields.io](https://shields.io/category/build) to create them. If you enter information about the repo as shown below, it will automatically fetch the information and create a badge for you.

You can paste it into your README and display the badge in the repository.
