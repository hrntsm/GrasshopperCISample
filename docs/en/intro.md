# Introduction

This page introduces an example of using CI, taking as an example the development of a component (plug-in) of Grasshopper, which is commonly used in architecture.

Most people who develop in the Japan architecture field are individuals and rarely develop in a group while receiving a thorough review (according to my research).
In such a situation, it is difficult to ensure the quality of the code you create by yourself.
So let's consider how to write quality code by setting up a system that automatically reviews your code using CI (Continuous Integration).
